Outliers have impact over 
1. Linear regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Ada boost
4. Deep learning 
algoritms. Because, in these algorithms we calculate weights. 

In tree based algorithms, it has not enough effects.

How to deal with outliers?
1. Trimming
    thin dataset
    fast
2. Capping

3. Consider them as missing value, and handle as missing value
4. Discretization of numerical value if outliers are numeric 

How to know wether we have outliers?
in Numerical Data -
    1. Normal Distribution : If we got any value outside of (miu +- 3sigma) then those values will be the outliers
    2. Skewed Distribution - If we got any value outside of (Q1-1.5IQR & Q3+1.5TQR) then those values will be the outliers
    3. Other Distribution : Ekhane percentile approach e jawa lage, like 98% er upore and 5% er niche jara tara amader outliers. Erokom higher and lower threshold dhore agano lage.     

Techniques for Outlier Detection and Removal :
    1. Z-Index treatment
    2. IQR based filtering
    3. Percentile
    4. Winsarization
